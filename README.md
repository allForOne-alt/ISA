'''IMPORTANT! IMPORTANT! IMPORTANT!'''

Summary of what needs to be submitted
-Your updated Weather Application (HTML/CSS/JS) that presents the information of your assigned city with changed URL of API (the actual files containing the code, NOT a screenshot)
-Your PHP Scripts (should have API client, API server as well as Database Load and Fetch components)
-Your MySQL Database Export of Weather Database


Use the command with your own MySQL user_name and database_name for export :  
```mysqldump -u user_name -p database_name > database_export.sql``` 
IF YOU DO NOT KNOW YOUR NAME JUST TYPE ```whoami``` in the terminal and you'll get the name

AND IF THIS DOESNOT WORK EVEN WITH THE NAME THEN DO THIS
```mysqldump -u root database_name > database_export.sql``` 
THIS WILL WORK AND IF YOU ARE PROMPTED TO ENTER A PASSWORD JUST PRESS ENTER WITHOUT TYPING ANYTHING


-A Short reflective report (PDF Document, about 300 words) on the strengths and weaknesses of your app’s architecture
